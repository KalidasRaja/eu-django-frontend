                <p>6.1 Your principal rights under GDPR are as follows:</p>
                <ul class=" list-decimal space-y-2.5 lg:space-y-3 ml-5 md:ml-8">
                    <li>the right to access your information;</li>
                    <li>the right to rectification of said information;</li>
                    <li>the right to erasure of said information;</li>
                    <li>the right to object to the processing of said information;</li>
                    <li>the right to lodge complaints with a supervisory authority; and</li>
                    <li>the right to withdraw consent.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>6.2 You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your personal data and, where
                    we do, access to the personal data, together with certain additional information. That additional
                    information includes details of the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data
                    concerned and the recipients of the personal data. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are
                    not affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data. The first copy will be provided
                    free of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee. You may ask for your
                    personal data by emailing <a href="mailto:dpo@6storage.com"
                        class=" text-blue-600 hover:underline">dpo@6storage.com.</a></p>
                <p>6.3 You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified and, taking into
                    account the purposes of the processing, have incomplete personal data about you completed.</p>
                <p>6.4 In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your personal data without undue
                    delay. Those circumstances include: the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the
                    purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based
                    processing; the processing is for direct marketing purposes; or the personal data have been
                    unlawfully processed. However, there are certain general exclusions of the right to erasure. Those
                    general exclusions include where processing is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of
                    expression and information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment,
                    exercise or defence of legal claims.</p>
                <p>6.5 In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. Those
                    circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data; the processing is unlawful but you
                    oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you
                    require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; and you have
                    objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection. Where processing has been
                    restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal data. However, we will only
                    otherwise process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;
                    for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important
                    public interest.</p>
                <p>6.6 You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your
                    particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the
                    processing is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the
                    exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued
                    by us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal
                    information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which
                    override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise
                    or defence of legal claims.</p>
                <p>6.7 You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing
                    purposes (including profiling for direct marketing purposes). If you make such an objection, we will
                    cease to process your personal data for this purpose.</p>
                <p>6.8 You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for scientific or historical
                    research purposes or statistical purposes on grounds relating to your particular situation, unless
                    the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public
                    interest.</p>
                <p>6.9 To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent,
                    you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness
                    of processing before the withdrawal.</p>
                <p>6.10 To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is consent, and such
                    processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your personal data from
                    us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply
                    where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.</p>
                <p>6.11 If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws,
                    you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data
                    protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or
                    the place of the alleged infringement.</p>
                <p>6.12 You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by emailing <a
